I decided this could be a sweet screensaver.... after seeing it on reddit... so here you go!

Step 1: Unzip and put 3 files in C:\Windows   
Step 2: right click BoxCar3D.scr that you put in C:\Windows and choose "Install".  
Step 3: After choosing Install via right click, the settings appear for screensavers.... now click "Settings" button for step 4: 
Step 4: For best options go to Settings and disable: "Exit on Keyboard & Exit on Mouse events." - now you can tweak the settings of the simulation without exiting the screensaver.... very cool eh? 
Hit Esc key to Exit!
